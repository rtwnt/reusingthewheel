Hi,
my name is Piotr Rusin, and I'm a software developer. Welcome to **Reusing the wheel** - a blog about my personal programming projects.

Sometimes I also write about linguistics and conlanging, which are my other hobbies and which also happen to be connected to some of my most recent software projects.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, or would like to contact me for any other reason, you can email me: contact@reusingthewheel.net
